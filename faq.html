                    <p>
                        Due to prevent processing delays, we unfortunately cannot combine multiple orders to ship together. Once an order is placed, changes cannot be made.

                    <p>
                        If you would like to cancel a pre-order, you must cancel on or before the stated deadline. Because pre-order items are made-to-order items, any cancellations made after the deadline may be subject to a cancellation fee of ten (10%) percent of the purchase price.

                        We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. At our discretion, we reserve the right to limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same name, the same credit card, Paypal account, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address, or orders using a discount code that is not permitted. In the event we make a change to or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

                The refund will take 3 - 4 business days appearing on customer's account. 
                Please note: with Squarespace's new refund regulation, there will be a 3.2% deduction for any

                With an exception for first time customers, we can waive the exchange fee. Returning shipping fee is solely dependent upon 
                customers.
