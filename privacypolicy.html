                <h3>4. How Do We Respond to ‘Do Not Track’ Signals?</h3>
                <p>
                    Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

                <h3>7. International Transfers of Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The Sites are intended for consumers in the United States. Any data that you provide to us may be accessed, shared or processed by our offices, located in the United States, and service providers located in the United States, if such data transfer is necessary for the specific purpose for which you submitted your data (such as the provision of goods or services under a written contract).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may entail a transfer of your personal information across international borders. The data protections standards may differ and be lower than the standards enforced in your jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We maintain appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law for any personal information transferred internationally, and as required by applicable law, will seek your consent prior to such transfers.
                </p>
            </li>

                <h3>8. Children’s Privacy</h3>
                <p>The Sites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in the “Contact Information” section below. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

                <h3>9. Change of Control</h3>
                <p>
                    Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change in control. If we sell, merge or transfer any part of the business, part of the sale may include your personal information.

                <h3>10. How Do We Protect Personal Information?</h3>
                <p>
                    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store data. We further limit access to this data using access controls and confidentiality commitments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
                </p>

            <h3>RETURNS</h3>
            <p>We accept Returns and Exchanges within 20 days after receiving the products. 
                Returned item must be in unused, unwashed, and clean condition.
                We provide refund only when the returned item is in sellable condition (unused and unwashed) with an original tag.
                The refund will take 3 - 4 business days appearing on customer's account. 
                Please note: with Squarespace's new refund regulation, there will be a 3.2% deduction for any
                amount of refund inside the US transactions and 4.5% for the international transactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a customer wants to exchange with other item, there will be a $10 exchange fee (plus one way shipping)
                applied unless the item has a defect or the reason for the exchange occurred following our instruction and guidance.
                With an exception for first time customers, we can waive the exchange fee. Returning shipping fee is solely dependent upon 
                customers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have to let go a particular customer when returning rate is over 80% and each case based on case by case basis.
